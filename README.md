## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly I learned where to find some things in Figma when working from a design. Overall the layout was fairly simple, however it's important to be sure you have fonts in the design installed on your system. I was also a little surprised with this design that I didn't have to look up any CSS concepts, I was able to implment CSS variables for the colors and transitions on the hover effects. 

### Continued development

I am going to continue to work on finding new CSS styling options as I feel like some of the techniques I'm using may be a little outdated.
